# DQNAgent-Connect-4
----
Developed a DQNAgent which can play connect 4 using reinforcement learning

1 model is included, if you wish to create your own, pull the repo and feel free to tinker with hyperparamters (or anything really, it's your clone)

Once runtime has started, you are prompted with options of how you wish to train your agent allowing you to create a new agent or continue training a previous one
You can choose to train against total randomness or an advanced bot, who rotates between optimal moves and random moves
You can also choose to actuall play against your agent to see how it now performs
